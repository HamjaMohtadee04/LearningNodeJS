# Node.js Fundamentals – Introduction

In this module, I explored the core fundamentals of Node.js, gaining a solid understanding of how its single-threaded, event-driven architecture works. I learned how Node.js handles asynchronous operations using the event loop, which manages different phases like timers, I/O callbacks, and the callback queue to ensure non-blocking behavior. This allows Node.js to handle multiple tasks concurrently, even though it runs on a single thread. I also studied how IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) work to create private scopes and avoid polluting the global namespace. Another key concept I explored was the difference between CommonJS and ES Modules. I compared their syntax, execution behavior, and use cases—understanding that CommonJS uses `require()` and `module.exports`, while ES Modules use `import` and `export`, offering better support for modern JavaScript and asynchronous loading. Overall, this module provided a strong introduction to the internal workings and module systems of Node.js.
